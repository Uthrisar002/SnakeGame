# Snake Game

## Overview
This project is a classic Snake game built using Python and the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to navigate the snake, eat food, and grow in length without colliding with the snake's own body. The game also features a wrapping mechanic, where the snake reappears on the opposite side of the screen if it exits the screen boundaries.

## Features
- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Control the snake using arrow keys to eat food and grow in length.
- **Screen Wrapping**: The snake wraps around the screen when it crosses the boundaries, reappearing on the opposite side.
- **Dynamic Score Tracking**: Your score increases as the snake consumes more food.
- **Retro Design**: The game interface is designed with a pixelated retro style for a nostalgic experience.
